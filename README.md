# Sentiment-Analysis
This project uses the AutoModel For Sequence Classification model 
from Hugging Face to perform sentiment analysis on comments from Yelp.
The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of text, and can be used to 
classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset
To get the data we scrapped Yelp.com for its comments using beautifulSoup. Then, we performed our analysis on those comments.

## Output
The output will be a list of comments, along with the predicted sentiment for each comment.

## Limitations:
The system is limited by the quality of the Yelp dataset. The dataset is constantly being updated, so the accuracy of the model may change over time. Additionally, the system is only as good as the model that is used. If a more sophisticated model is used, the accuracy of the system may improve.

## Future work:
The system could be improved by using a more comprehensive dataset of Yelp comments. Additionally, the system could be improved by using a more sophisticated sentiment analysis algorithm.
